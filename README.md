# Bot Battlr
Welcome to Bot Battlr, the one and only spot in the known universe where you can custom build your own Bot Army! This is our app:


# Instructions
For this project, you’ll be building out a React application that displays a list of available bots, among other features. Try your best to find the right places to insert code into the established code base.

Part of what this code challenge is testing is your ability to follow given instructions. While you will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in how you implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for setting up the application.

# Pre-requisite Data
In your project directory, create a db.json file and use this dataLinks to an external site. for your server DB.

Run this command to get the backend started: json-server --watch db.json

Test your server by visiting this route in the browser: [http://localhost:3000/bot]

# Project Setup
Run npm install in your terminal.

Run npm run server. This will run your backend on port 8001.

In a new terminal, run npm start. This will run your React app on port 3000.

Open http://localhost:3000/bot in the browser to verify that your backend is working before you proceed!

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

# Core Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:

See profiles of all bots rendered in BotCollection.
Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should render in the YourBotArmy component. The bot can be enlisted only once. The bot does not disappear from the BotCollection.
Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the YourBotArmy component.
Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the YourBotArmy on the frontend.
# Endpoints for Core Deliverables

# Advanced Deliverables
These deliverables are not required to pass the code challenge, but if you have the extra time, or even after the code challenge, they are a great way to stretch your skills.

Note: If you are going to attempt these advanced deliverables, please be sure to have a working commit with all the Core Deliverables first!

As a user, I should be able to:

Choose if I want to enlist a bot into my army or just see their data. Clicking on the card should instead display a show view (BotSpecs) for that bot, which should replace BotsCollection. BotSpecs should have two buttons: one to go back to the list view and another to enlist that bot. Your app could look like the following:
